# ESP32-Encoder
ESP32 library for rotary encoders

This library is a simplified copy of the "Paul Stoffregen" library https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Encoder.
The original library gave problems when using it with an ESP32 card, in this version all the code for other cards has been removed and the endoder button management has been added
